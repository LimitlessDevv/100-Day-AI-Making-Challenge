# AI Making Challenge - Day 11

## ðŸ’¡ Topic : Building a Full-stack Application with GitHub Copilot

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
While 'Vibe coding' tools like Lovable and Base44 can handle the entire process from app development to deployment using their own integrated backends, I understand that to deploy an application on my own cloud environment, like Azure or on-prem, I need to develop the backend myself.

But I want to gain hands-on experience by deploying an app directly on Azure using a tech stack of Node.js and PostgreSQL. To do this, I plan to use GitHub Copilot to assist with the development process and handle the cloud deployment myself.
