Create a warm, family-centered video set during the Korean holiday Chuseok. Show a cozy kitchen where both men and women — parents, grandparents, and young adults — are gathered together making "jeon" (Korean savory pancakes). 

The atmosphere should feel festive and joyful, with the smell of food and soft sunlight coming through the window. Include lively motions: flipping the jeon on a frying pan, chatting, and laughing together. The camera angle should switch between close-ups of sizzling jeon and wide shots of the family cooking together.

Add dialogue in Korean: 
"전 뒤집어라~ 다 탄다!" 
"네네~~" 

Make the lip movements and facial expressions naturally synchronized with the voices. Add Korean subtitles at the bottom matching the dialogue. Include realistic sound effects like frying sounds and gentle background chatter. Video length: about 8 seconds.
